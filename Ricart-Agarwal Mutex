Algo:
To enter Critical section:
  -> When a site Si wants to enter the critical section, it send a timestamped REQUEST message to all other sites.
  -> When a site Sj receives a REQUEST message from site Si, It sends a REPLY message to site Si if and only if
      -> Site Sj is neither requesting nor currently executing the critical section.
      -> In case Site Sj is requesting, the timestamp of Site Siâ€˜s request is smaller than its own request.
To execute the critical section:
  -> Site Si enters the critical section if it has received the REPLY message from all other sites.
To release the critical section:
  -> Upon exiting site Si sends REPLY message to all the deferred requests.
